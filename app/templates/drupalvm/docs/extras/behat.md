Behat is an open source behavior-driven development tool for PHP. You can use Behat to build and run automated tests for site functionality on your Drupal sites, and Drupal VM has excellent built-in support for Behat, using Selenium to run tests in a headless instance of FireFox.

## Getting Started - Installing Prerequisites

To make Behat available globally for all your projects within Drupal VM, make the following changes inside `config.yml`, then run `vagrant up` (or `vagrant provision` if the VM is already built):

```yaml
# Make sure selenium is not commented out in the list of installed_extras:
installed_extras:
  [...]
  - selenium
  [...]

# Make sure the following four packages are in composer_global_packages:
composer_global_packages:
  - { name: behat/mink, release: '1.5.*@stable' }
  - { name: behat/mink-goutte-driver, release: '*' }
  - { name: behat/mink-selenium2-driver, release: '*' }
  - { name: drupal/drupal-extension, release: '*' }
```

After Drupal VM is finished provisioning, you should be able to log in and run the following command to make sure Behat is installed correctly:

```
$ behat --version
behat version 3.0.15
```

_You can also include the `behat/*` and `drupal/drupal-extension` directly in your project's `composer.json` file, and install the dependencies per-project. Either option (installing globally, like above, or installing per-project) is perfectly acceptable._

## Setting up Behat for your project

Using the default Drupal site as an example (it's installed in `/var/www/drupalvm/drupal` by default, and is shared to `~/Sites/drupalvm/drupal` on your host machine), the following steps will help you get your first Behat tests up and running!

  1. Create a `behat.yml` file inside the docroot of your site (e.g. create this file alongside the rest of the Drupal codebase at `/var/www/drupalvm/drupal/behat.yml`), with the following contents:

        default:
          suites:
            web_features:
              paths: [ %paths.base%/features/web ]
              contexts:
                - WebContext
                - Drupal\DrupalExtension\Context\DrupalContext
                - Drupal\DrupalExtension\Context\MinkContext
                - Drupal\DrupalExtension\Context\MessageContext
                - Drupal\DrupalExtension\Context\DrushContext
          extensions:
            Behat\MinkExtension:
              goutte: ~
              javascript_session: selenium2
              selenium2:
                wd_host: http://drupalvm.dev:4444/wd/hub
              base_url: http://drupalvm.dev
            Drupal\DrupalExtension:
              blackbox: ~
              api_driver: 'drupal'
              drupal:
                drupal_root: '/var/www/drupalvm/drupal'
              region_map:
                content: "#content"

  2. Log into Drupal VM with `vagrant ssh`, change directory to the Drupal site root (`cd /var/www/drupalvm/drupal`), then run `behat --init` to initialize the `features` folder where you will place test cases.
  3. From either inside the VM or on the host machine, open up the new `features/web` folder Behat just created. Inside _that_ folder, create `HomeContent.feature` with the following contents:

        Feature: Test DrupalContext
          In order to prove the Behat is working correctly in Drupal VM
          As a developer
          I need to run a simple interface test

          Scenario: Viewing content in a region
            Given I am on the homepage
            Then I should see "No front page content has been created yet" in the "content"

  4. Now, inside Drupal VM, change directory to `/var/www/drupalvm/drupal` again, and run the command `behat` (which runs all the tests you've createdâ€”which should just be one so far).

If everything was done correctly, you should see:

```console
$ behat
Feature: Test DrupalContext
  In order to prove the Behat is working correctly in Drupal VM
  As a developer
  I need to run a simple interface test

  Scenario: Viewing content in a region                                             # features/drupal/HomeContent.feature:6
    Given I am on the homepage                                                      # Drupal\DrupalExtension\Context\MinkContext::iAmOnHomepage()
    Then I should see "No front page content has been created yet" in the "content" # Drupal\DrupalExtension\Context\MinkContext::assertRegionText()
